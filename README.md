# stream-render - render templates asynchronous
## Introduction
With `stream-render` you can insert information into files before you send them to the user.
The advantage of `stream-render` is that it processes your file line by line so it uses few memory and the processed lines can be send to the user immediately.
## Templates
The easiest way is to create a directory called `views` in your projects folder.
Then you can create Templates in this directory.
There is no special file extension that you have to use. You can use `.html`, `.txt` and others.
## Example - Template
This is a file called `<pathToYourProject>/views/example.txt`
